  # @param auto_delete: If set, the exchange is deleted when all queues have

  # Specifies quality of service.
  #
  # This method requests a specific quality of service. The QoS can be
  # specified for the current channel or for all channels on the connection.
  # The particular properties and semantics of a qos method always depend on
  # the content class semantics. Though the qos method could in principle apply
  # to both peers, it is currently meaningful only for the server.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #
  # @param prefetch_size: The client can request that messages be sent in
  # advance so that when the client finishes processing a message, the
  # following message is already held locally, rather than needing to be sent
  # down the channel. Prefetching gives a performance improvement. This field
  # specifies the prefetch window size in octets. The server will send a
  # message in advance if it is equal to or smaller in size than the available
  # prefetch size (and also falls into other prefetch limits). May be set to
  # zero, meaning "no specific limit", although other prefetch limits may still
  # apply. The prefetch-size is ignored if the no-ack option is set.
  #
  # @param prefetch_count: Specifies a prefetch window in terms of whole
  # messages. This field may be used in combination with the prefetch-size
  # field; a message will only be sent in advance if both prefetch windows (and
  # those at the channel and connection level) allow it. The prefetch-count is
  # ignored if the no-ack option is set.
  #
  # @param global: RabbitMQ has reinterpreted this field. The original
  # specification said: "By default the QoS settings apply to the current
  # channel only. If this field is set, they are applied to the entire
  # connection." Instead, RabbitMQ takes global=false to mean that the QoS
  # settings should apply per-consumer (for new consumers on the channel;
  # existing ones being unaffected) and global=true to mean that the QoS
  # settings should apply per-channel.

  # an acknowledgement (if required), or enqueued the message (and persisted it
  # if required). Published messages are assigned ascending sequence numbers,
